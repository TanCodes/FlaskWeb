### About the FlaskWeb

I'm currently working on Flask Flask which is a Python web framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy.

1 Created main python file.
2 In templates folder created home ,login and register all html files.
3 In static folder created style file which is an css file.
4 Also added some Javascripts code in my html files just for validation purpose .
5 For storing data i used phpmyadmin which is an free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web.
6 Added some Bootstrap , [Sweetalert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/) and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start) which gave my website real look.
